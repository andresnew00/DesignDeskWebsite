              understanding your business, your competitors, your current online
              presence, and your desired outcome from your new website.
            </b>
            Usually, the discovery process takes place over 2-3 in-person
            meetings and a couple of phone calls. This is us setting the
            concrete for the foundation of your company’s new online home.{" "}
            <br></br> <br></br> During these meetings, we will do thorough
            research into your company’s performance in your industry; a full
            evaluation of your online presence, and an analysis of your
            competitors’ online strategy. You’ll decide on Key Performance
            Indicators (KPIs) for your new site’s success (more traffic, more
            sales, more inquiries, etc.) and then you can move onto sharing
            examples of sites that inspire you. Essentially, the Discovery
            Process is us getting to know you and your business, so we can fully
            realize your online potential with your new site.

              mood board creation and wireframes for key pages, in addition to
              collecting all the text, images, files, and documents needed for

            During this phase, we will meet a couple of more times to make sure
            we are on the same page and ready to move on. Don't worry we will
            work closely with you to make sure you understand what is happening
            during each stage of your project. Once everything is gathered
            together, you can sign off on this step, and we can then move onto
            the graphic design element and mock-ups.
